<h1 align="middle">Assignment 3: PathTracer</h1>
    <h2 align="middle">Max Litster and Aidan Meyer</h2>

    <div class="padded">
      <p> For this assignment we learned how to create images with perspective and varying degrees of detailed lighting.
      This was accomplished via ray tracing: the process of simulating viewing rays launched from the camera, through pixels
      on the screen to objects in scene, and tracing those rays back to their source to determine how bright a given pixel
      should be. </p>
    <p> This project was very complex: not only did we learn how to implement the increasingly intricate properties of
      natural light (bouncing off surfaces that do and do not emit light, accounting for the properties of different materials),
      but we also dealt with the complexities in simulating and displaying natural objects and perspectives. Additionally
      we dealt with a lot of bugs in calculating intersections and implementing formulas, which trained us to appropriately
      debug graphics programs, particularly when rendering is expensive and time-consuming. </p>
    <p> Ultimately this was rewarding in that we generated cool images and got to really understand the process of rendering complicated
      3D visuals with physically-accurate perspectives and lighting. </p>
    <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Ray Generation and Intersection</h2>

      <p>
        For ray generation, we first scaled our x and y coordinates to that of the camera space by using the tangent and field-of-view formulas from the spec, and appropriate offsets following from the new dimensions. We then used these coordinates to get at the direction of the vector leaving the camera, and scaled this to world space. We then added the appropriate min and max t-values and return the given ray.
        <br>
        <br>
        For primitive intersection we used the formulas defining a circle or triangle and used the ray equation to calculate their point of intersection.
        <br>
        <br>
        For triangle intersection it is possible to use plane intersection and check if the intersected point is in the triangle with the classic in-triangle check used in the first project. We decided to use the  Möller–Trumbore intersection algorithm since it is optimized and uses Barrycentric coordinate definitions to check the intersection of a ray and a triangle.
        <br>
        <br>
        Additionally we were able to throw out valid solutions to the Matrix-Vector equation posed by the M-T algorithm that were not consistent with the barycentric coordinates by ensuring that the intersection time t was valid and the barycentric coordinates appropriately added to 1.

    <h2 align="middle">Part 2</h2>

    <p>For the BVH construction we split on the longest dimension at the average
      position in that dimension to ensure about half of the primitives were on
      either side of the partition after the split. After parting the primitives
       in this way we constructed left and right nodes to create a tree like
       structure and recursively called the construct until we hit the leaf case
       where the max_leaf_size was not exceeded by the amount of primitives.

    <p>The runtime after applying BVH acceleration dramatically decreased.
      After the BVH Acceleration implementation the console completed the render
      in (0.0019 sec) whereas before the render completed in 36.6670s. The BVH
      of course took a longer time to construct, but this difference is less than
       a second. With this preprocessing we were able to get a dramatic speed up.
        This behavior was expected as it changes the complexity of the problem from O(N) to O(logN).
        We no longer check every primitive with every ray, but rather traverse
        the BVH with bbox intersection calculations, greatly decreasing the number
        of primitives we try to intersect with our ray.
    </p>


    <h2 align="middle">Part 3</h2>

    <p>In order to implement direct lighting via uniform hemisphere sampling, we take the rays cast from the camera and identify those that intersect with an object in the scene. If it intersects at a point hit_p, we evaluate the lighting by integrating over the light arriving in a hemisphere around the hit point. This we determine via a Monte Carlo estimator.
First, we reverse the direction of the ray colliding with the object to trace the light that returns to the camera. We then Sample N ray directions uniformly from the hemisphere surrounding the hit point. For each ray direction, we simulate a new ray originating from the hit point and trace it to see if it intersects with a light-emitting object. If it does, we trace the incoming light from that direction (determined via the emission function of the BSDF of the intersecting object) and multiply this by the `f` value of the original object’s BSDF. We sum these values as well as the cosine of the incoming ray, and normalize this total value by the PDF, and divide by the number of samples. </p>

    <p> For the second direct lighting function we did importance sampling. This relied on the light sources within the scene and receiving the sample based on the point and the light. This gave us a pdf that we use alternatively to uniform sampling in the last part. We then only calculated the reflectance if the object did not intersect anything between it and the light and if the incoming angle actually hit the surface. This has two benefits that we observed. It created a less noisy image and sped up the one_bounce since there were less samples needed to see surfaces that reflect light. </p>

    <p>With importance sampling, we put more weight on sampling rays that come from the light sources, because
      they are more likely to actually emit light than surfaces with low probability of emitting light. As a result
    the image displays sharper, less noisy and more realistic shadows.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 4</h2>

    <p>
For indirect lighting we implemented multiple bounces for one point on an object. This allowed us to include the reflected light from other surfaces into the final illuminance that goes into the pixel ray. We did this by including a depth and then later a russian roulette implementation that probabilistically ends the recursive bounce call. At each bounce we returned the direct one bounce lighting and then used then sent out a recursive call to the function and included the returned reflectance. This illuminates the parts of the scene that aren’t directly under a light.

  <p>Adaptive sampling was implemented by computing the illuminance of the radiance at each step.
    As we iterated over the number of samples, we kept a running sum of the illuminance and the
    squared illuminance. With these sums, we computed the mean and standard deviation / variance
    every samplesPerBatch iterations. We then checked whether or not the variable ‘I’ as defined
    in the spec, was less than the mean times the maxTolerance, indicating that our pixel value
    fell within the confidence interval. If so, we broke with the loop and wrote out our value
    to the sampleCountBuffer.  </p>

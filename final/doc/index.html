		<h1>CS184 Final Project: MeshCut</h1>
		<h2>
			Project Overview
		</h2>
		<p>
			Our project concerns rendering a realistic cut of a mesh.
			In order to do so, we implement a basic framework for cutting
			a mesh that relies on modifying the components of the mesh
			that we worked with in Project 2, contained in the Half-Edge
			data structure, and then plan to enable parameterized cuts
			(i.e., defining different planes to cut across) and differing levels
			of "stickiness" that cause the mesh to resist the cut or separate in different
			ways.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Final Project Milestone Report
		</h2>
			<h3>
				Project Status
			</h3>
			<p>
				Currently, the project builds on the Project 2 GUI to implement a basic
				mesh operation that we dub "clean cut": a simple separation of the mesh
				into a left and right side of the cut that slices the mesh by removing the
				primitives in the middle of the two sides; those that intersect the
				simple vertical plane that we cut across.
				<br><br>
				To accomplish this, we iterate through the half-edges of the mesh, using
				dot product of the difference between the vertex position and point defining
				the plane and the normal vector of the plane to determine whether it lies to
				the right or left of the cut. From here, we collect a list of edges
				that see one vertex on the right and the other on the left. We consider these
				'cross-edges' (as they cross the cut) and remove them. What remains is a mesh
				cut into two pieces.

			<h3>
				Preliminary Results
			</h3>
			<p>
				As the following screenshot shows, we have achieved a basic "clean cut" implementation.
				We are still working to define precise metrics to measure the quality of the
				cut or simulation beyond qualitative evaluation of the image.

			<h3>
				Progress Relative to Plan
			</h3>
			<p>
				The clean cut was the first stage of our plan, and it was useful in that it allowed
				us to work with the half-edge data structure in the context of a cut. For example,
				the dot product between the difference vector and normal vector was a very useful tool
				to determine the direction in which the mesh needs to separate. Additionally, we have
				some solid framework code for navigating the intersected edges via half-edge traversals.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Updated Plan
			</h3>
			<p>
				Our next steps will be to implement the stickiness slider and a
				parameterization of the cutting plane, to define the different angles at which
				we will cut the mesh. A stretch goal at this point would be animating the cut:
				specifically because the motion of a material once it is cut relies heavily on the physics
				of the material. To appropriately render this we may have to implement some of the force
				modelling employed in Project 4.

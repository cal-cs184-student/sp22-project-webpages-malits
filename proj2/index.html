	<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
	In this project, we implemented several rendering algorithms for triangle-based meshes to bring dynamic curves and surfaces to
	our screens. As a whole, this bridged the gap from simple triangle rendering to more complex meshes like the teapot or tourus.
	One of the largest takeaways from this project was the need to use sophisticated data structures to navigate the complexity of
	such meshes. The half-edge in particular is capable of representing such complicated meshes, but is designed in such a way that
	after surmounting the initial learning curve, one can navigate the meshes a relatively straightforward manner.

<p>With the Castelijau’s algorithm we take a set of points that form a line and then calculate midsections of each pair of points in the line parameterized by the value t. We then take this new line of points and recursively call the algorithm till we receive one point. This point is considered to be a point on the Bezier curve . By running the Castelijau’s algorithm iteratively through values of t 0 to 1, we can evaluate the entire Bezier curve of this line.</p>

<p>With surfaces we add a dimension to the problem, in order to account for this we solve for the bezier curve in one dimension and then with those points we solve for the bezier curve along the other.  Both parameters u and v are used the same way as t in the normal Castelijau’s algorithm and iterated through to give the points of the surface. We use u to move through one dimension as the parameterizing value and then we use v to calculate the curve in the next dimension. This curve can be thought of as moving through the dimension on all of the u parameterized curves.

To compute the area-weighted vertex normal, we iterated through each face incident
to a vertex and computed its normal. The iteration was done by navigating half-edges.
We then summed the vertices and normalized the sum to get the area-weighted vertex norm,
which we returned as the norm of the desired vertex.

	Edge-flipping was implemented by explicitly reassigning each half-edge, face,
  edge, and vertex to the flipped configuration shown in the spec. First, for
  the incident triangles, we selected each vertex, edge, face, and half-edge,
  and reassigned them to the new configuration. The implementation was a fairly
  straightforward set of half-edge accesses and reassignments, however debugging
  required meticulous sketching of the triangles pre and post-flip, and coding
  explicit reassignments for each component of the triangle, even those that were
  not changed. While this required some repetitive code, it made our debugging
  journey fairly straightforward, as explicitly accessing and reassigning things
  based on the diagram was fairly self-explanatory.

  Edge-splitting was a bit more involved than edge-flipping, because we also had
   to create new edges, half-edges, and a vertex midpoint.
   Again, we explicitly reassigned each component of the triangle,
   this time incorporating the new midpoint and corresponding new edges,
   half-edges, and faces. Debugging was again relatively straightforward:
   errors mostly arose from looking at how we may have incorrectly assigned
   a particular vertex or edge. Our debugging journey mostly consisted of
   scrutinizing our code to ensure that we correctly moved all of our pointers
   / triangle attributes to match the desired configuration.

For loop subdivision We first calculated new positions of old vectors and then new positions of vectors to be added between edges. We then split all existing edges and flipped the new edges that had both an old vertex and new vertex. To make sure we did not account half of the split edge as a new edge we added a boolean to the edge implementation called dup so that this edge would not get flipped. In splitting the edge we also assigned the newPosition of the new vertex to the newPosition of the edge that it originally split. Finally We updated the positions of all vertices to their newPosition. To debug we returned the algorithm before position updates to make sure the split and flip worked correctly. Then we had a bug related to position updating that was hidden in a wrong vertex assignment in the flip edge function. To debug this we did all sorts of things from changing the u values to analyzing the degree of the vertices.

The sharp corners of the cube begin to dull and smoothen out as a result of the averaging. I can imagine that prepr-splitting would give shorter distances between vertices to average so the updated vertices would be less drastically averaged.

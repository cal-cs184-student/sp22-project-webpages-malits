    <div class="padded">
        <p>In this assingment we extended our pathtracer to account for Microfacet BSDFs, allowing us to render different, more realistic materials,
          and different lens features to allow for richer lens effects. This was really cool because we got to reap the rewards of tricky implementations
          in Part 3 by expanding on them with additional materials and lens effects. The rendered images turned out to be really realistic and cool!
        <br><br>
          The math was a bit more involved this time, which made implementation and derivation a little trickier. We definitely had some issues with
          importance sampling for the Microfacet BSDF, as the different angles and vector formulas were difficult to wrap our heads around. It was also tricky
          to visualize the ray-plane intersections needed to complete Part 4, but very rewarding once we did: the images were super cool!
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Aidan and I collaborated really well! We split up the work and checked in to review each other's code and explain our design decisions.
          We debugged one another's code to pick up on things the other may have missed. As roommates, collaboration and time coordination is pretty easy.
        </p>
    <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Microfacet Material</h2>
    <br>
    For our implementation of the Microfacet BSDF we implemented the formulas outlined in the spec. First,
    implementing the 'f' function by computing the desired quotient:
    <img align="center" src="images/formula.png"/>
    <br>
    The bulk of this part of the porject consisted of implementing the formulas outlined in the spec. Computing importace sampling (Task 4 in this part) was a bit
    more difficult because we had to figure out how to compute the reflection as well as the h vector from the sampled angles. Once derived though, we achieved some cool results!

    First, note the effect of changing roughness (alpha): the lower the roughness, the more reflective the material. As it gets rougher (higher alpha), the reflectiveness
    decreases.

    The following images show the differences between hemisphere sampling and importance sampling.
    As you can see, hemisphere sampling is noisier while importance sampling
    creates much more directed and realistic shading effects. We struggled a bit
    to reduce the noise in these images, but this likely would be resolved by
    increasing the sampling rate per pixel from 64 to a greater value.

    <h2 align="middle">Part 4: Depth-of-Field</h2>
    A pinhole camera model treats the scene as viewed through a pinhole: where a direct ray is shot from a pixel on the screen to the objects
    in scene, the intersections determining what we display. The thin-lens model introduces the effect of a curved lens, where we sample locations on
    the glass surface and generate a reflected ray to simulate the visuals of a lens. Instead of a direct ray shooting from image space to scene,
    we now reflect that ray through the curved surface of the lens.
    <br>
    To compute this, we first use the pinhole ray-tracing procedure to identify
    a point in the scene that our ray intersects. From there, we sample a location on the lens and generate a new ray from that point on the lens
    to the intersection point in the scene.
    <br>
    This new ray is no longer just a direct line from pixel on the image to an object in the world space. Instead, it reflects the curvature of
    the lens and gives us a series of cool perceptive effects that showcase the depth of the field of view. This implementation was fairly straightforward,
    but we had some trouble with the intersection calculations which were very tricky! We ended up leveraging the intersection formula and the ray
    computed as done in the original ray-tracing assignment to find its intersection with the desired plane on the z-axis.
